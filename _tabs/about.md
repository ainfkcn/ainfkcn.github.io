I am **Dongliang Zhang**, a software engineer currently based at **Lalamove (HuoLaLa)**.

Before joining Lalamove, I was a developer at **Huawei**, specializing in the **5G Core UDG** product. My work focused on K8s template development, engineering maintenance, and troubleshooting instantiation failures.

Beyond the code, I am a fan of ACG (Anime, Comic, and Games) culture. On pseudonymous platforms, I prefer to express myself through my original character: **Claire Song**, a self-proclaimed "Little Witch" and apprentice to the Grand Witch, **Izayoi Oriyuki**.

This blog is primarily a space for sharing technical insights, with occasional detours into creative writing. My works, including both **fanfiction** and **original stories**, are also available on **AO3** if posted.
